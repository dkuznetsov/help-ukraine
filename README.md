Even before the conflict escalated this week, there were already 400,000 children there who needed humanitarian aid.

That's why Save the Children has made their own [Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund](https://support.savethechildren.org/site/Donation2?df_id=5751&mfc_pref=T&5751.donation=form1) to help Ukrainian families now.

# Humanitarian Aid
### Official Fundraising Account for Humanitarian Assistance to Ukrainians Affected by Russia’s Aggression
The account is meant for charity contributions from Ukraine and from abroad. The Ministry of Social Policy will channel the raised funds to support Ukraine’s citizens severely affected by the war.

“Russian aggression deprived thousands of Ukrainians of their home, money, clothes, food, and other basic things. However, Ukraine and the rest of the world would not leave them alone with their grief. Financial support keeps coming both from the citizens of our country and from abroad. To streamline the inflows of funds as humanitarian aid to Ukrainians affected by the war, the NBU has opened an account for the Ministry of Social Policy to accumulate charitable contributions for social needs in wartime. Unlike the special account that has been opened to finance the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, money from this account will be used to help those hardest-hit by the war with Russia,” - said the NBU Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko.

Money transferred to this account will be used by the Ministry of Social Policy:

-   to provide food and shelter for refugees and citizens that have been displaced due to military conflict
-   to provide clothing, shoes, and medicine for them
-   to buy staple goods for the population
-   to pay out one-off financial aid and to meet other essential needs of the population.

Account details of the Ministry of Social Policy are below: UA823000010000032302338301027.

This account accepts multiple currencies. It has been established and opened to receive transfers from international partners and donors both in foreign currency (U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds) and from Ukrainian business and citizens in hryvnias.

If necessary, the NBU will update the payment details for charitable assistance for humanitarian purposes.

Support Ukraine, help Ukrainians!

Thanks to the overwhelming generosity of supporters, the Government of Canada match of $10 million has now been met. Your donation will support those impacted by the crisis in Ukraine. Thank you for your generosity.

Money raised will enable the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to respond to humanitarian needs generated by almost eight years of conflict, as well as preparedness and response efforts due to heightened tensions in Ukraine. The support could include preparedness, immediate and ongoing relief efforts, long-term recovery, resiliency, and other critical humanitarian activities as needs arise, both in Ukraine and surrounding countries, including supporting populations displaced.

### Canada-Ukraine Foundation
[Gofundme page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/helpukrainenow-ukraine-humanitarian-appeal)
[Official CUF Website](http://www.cufoundation.ca)
Last week, Russia declared war on Ukraine. The Russian army has attacked military facilities, infrastructure and civilian targets. The WHO health cluster estimates that the number of affected people has climbed from 2.9 million a week ago, to over 18 million today.

The Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal, established by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC) and the Canada-Ukraine Foundation (CUF) is working with Ukrainian government ministries, who are in the best position to advise on the needs on the ground so that we can ensure that the donations we receive meet the needs of the Ukrainian people.

The UCC-CUF Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal has already deployed approximately $500,000 CAD to provide food packages, medicine and shelter. Subsequent tranches of support will follow as we monitor delivery and needs.

“As of 9:00 am EST on February 28, the Appeal has raised over $4 million from a broad base of supporters across Canada – provincial governments, family foundations, community organizations, credit unions, public and private companies, and thousands of individual donors,” said Orest Sklierenko, President and CEO of CUF. “I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from every corner of Canada, who share the horror of the war being waged by Russia against the Ukrainian people.”

“We are extremely grateful to all Canadians for their continued generosity and support at this time of need,” said Alexandra Chyczij, President of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. “Putin must be held to account in the International Criminal Court of Justice where he should be tried for war crimes.”

Please donate to the appeal today to support millions of Ukrainian families who have been displaced from their homes. #HelpUkraineNow.

### Global Giving Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund
The Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund by Global Giving sprung into action once Russia declared war on Ukraine earlier this week.

According to the organization's [official website](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/ukraine-crisis-relief-fund/), your donation will help "affected communities in Ukraine, with a focus on the most vulnerable, including children, who need access to food, medical services, and psychosocial support."

Not only that, but the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund will "support humanitarian assistance in impacted communities in Ukraine and surrounding regions where Ukrainian refugees have fled."


### The International Committee of the Red Cross
The [International Committee of the Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/en/donate/ukraine) is helping the Ukrainian Red Cross assist people who were affected by the conflict there.

Once war broke out, ICRC president Peter Maurer released a statement on the organization's [website](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/statement-icrc-president-peter-maurer-conflict-ukraine).

"The ICRC’s priority is to assist those in need," he said. "This week we delivered 3,000 liters of potable water to Dokuchaevsk hospital and sent 7,000 liters to Donetsk municipality."

"Recent work also includes visits to places of detention to help improve hygiene and nutrition," he added. "The security situation permitting, our teams now in Ukraine will continue their work to repair vital infrastructure, support health facilities with medicines and equipment, and support families with food and hygiene items."

"We will also continue our bilateral and confidential dialogue with the parties to the conflict to protect those affected by the fighting," Maurer continued.

### CARE
CARE is raising money for its [Ukraine Crisis Fund](https://my.care.org/site/Donation2?df_id=31071&mfc_pref=T&31071.donation=form1&s_src=172220UCFM00&s_subsrc=FY22UkraineCrisisFundMO), which will provide immediate aid including food, water, hygiene kits, support services and direct cash assistance.

“The Jewish community in Ukraine is in need of your assistance during these dire times. As the threat of war intensifies, Mishpacha Chabad Odessa is preparing to support the hundreds of Jews who are unable to evacuate the country including orphans, students, and Holocaust survivors. Preparations are also underway to absorb Jewish refugees from the surrounding regions of Kharkiv, Kiev, and Dnieper. $500,000 in donations are urgently needed to purchase medical gear, protective equipment, and basic necessities such as clothes and sleeping bags. Money is also needed to help stock emergency shelters with several tons of cereal, buckwheat, sugar, rice, flour and other non-perishable staples. These donations will also help defray the costs of additional security personnel arriving from Israel to help protect the Jewish community.”
### CNEWA
"Catholic Near East Welfare Association (CNEWA) has been a lifeline for the poor throughout the Middle East, Northeast Africa, India and Eastern Europe for 90 years."

"Many of us did not believe this could happen. Now an invasion is a reality in all of Ukraine.

On February 24, Ukraine’s borders were attacked and its major cities were bombed by Russian troops. Not being a member of any military alliance, Ukraine is left to withstand the second largest army in the world on its own.

This kind of violence is painful to watch for Christians and people of good will throughout the world. The number of casualties continues to grow and the story is changing by the hour. But what cannot change is our deep commitment to help innocent people whose lives are in danger.

We are reaching out to you for help, if you are able.  A generous family from Alberta has pledged to match all donations in support of humanitarian aid in Ukraine up to $500,000. Please donate generously!"

"The world is a tragically different place after Russia unleashed war in the heart of Europe in the early hours of February 24, 2022. The Russian Armed Forces are shelling peaceful cities, bringing death and terror to Ukraine and to the whole European continent in an attempt to deprive Ukraine of its independence. The people of Ukraine are resolute and are standing in defense of their families, their homes, and their national dignity. It is up to us to support Ukraine at this critical moment. The Ukrainian World Congress, together with our communities and partners, coordinates much needed emergency humanitarian response, provides medical supplies and protective equipment to Ukraine."
